## Project Overview

A web-based Student Management System implemented for a Software Engineering (SEN) assignment to facilitate student record management. This project demonstrates practical application of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles from planning and design through implementation and testing.

## Management

The system allows users to enter student details including student ID, full name, email, department, and level. All records are displayed in a structured table, and students can be deleted when necessary. Data is stored using the browser’s localStorage, ensuring that records persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using HTML for structuring web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for implementing system logic and managing data. No external frameworks or libraries were used, making the application lightweight and easy to understand. The system runs entirely in a web browser without requiring a backend server.

## SDLC Implementation

This repository contains the complete source code and reflects all stages of the SDLC, including planning, requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The application was tested to ensure proper functionality of adding, viewing, and deleting student records.
